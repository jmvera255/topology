Name: PercARsolar
Description: "Project entails the participation of a number of students in a graduate level class in running a code that simulates the evolution of solar active regions as a percolation phenomenon. A number of students will continue the research as part of their Master's thesis at Chicago State University. Computationally, the project builds upon work done previously by Seiden and Wentzel, by adding a new algorithm in tracking the polarity of the magnetic field structures on the solar photosphere. Requirements for the project is python version 3+. Typical single core walltime of each job is 1 hour for a modest resolution of a 2D grid. Upper limit of walltime is about 3 hours for the highest resolution consistent with the limitations of the algorithm.The project seeks to determine the steady state of the solar cycle by varying the emergence and diffusion probability parameters of magnetic flux tubes. The percolation engine is inherently chaotic and finely tuned values for these parameters are sought in a sweep of the probability space through a large volume of jobs."
